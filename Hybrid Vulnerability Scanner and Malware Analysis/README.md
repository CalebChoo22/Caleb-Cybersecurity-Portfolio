Hybrid Vulnerability and Malware Scanner

I made this project in Python where it combines a system vulnerability scanner and a malware analyzer. This project was designed using tools like Lynis, Nmap, and YARA.


Vulnerability Scanning
	•	Lynis: Performs system security audits
	•	Nmap: Scans open ports, services, and OS information on localhost

Malware Analysis
	•	File hashing (MD5 and SHA256)
	•	Static string extraction
	•	YARA rule matching
	•	JSON report generation


This project demonstrates:
  •	Basic offensive and defensive security tooling
	•	File integrity concepts
	•	Automation of security processes
	•	Real world threat signature scanning (YARA)
